Naming your tests
    The name of your test should consist of three parts:

    The name of the method being tested.
    The scenario under which it's being tested.
    The expected behavior when the scenario is invoked.

Arranging your tests
    Arrange, Act, Assert is a common pattern when unit testing. As the name implies, it consists of three main actions:

    Arrange your objects, create and set them up as necessary.
    Act on an object.
    Assert that something is as expected.
